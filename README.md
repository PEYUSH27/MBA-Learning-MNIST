# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project uses TensorFlow and MNIST dataset to train a neural network that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9). You can upload an image of a digit, and the model will predict it using Google Colab.

## Usage
1. Train the model using `mnist_model.h5` or use the pre-trained one.
2. Upload a handwritten digit image via Google Colab.
3. The model will predict and display the digit.
